# CVWO todolist
 
Through this project I learnt the basics of React.js and Golang. Initially I wanted to implement an authentication system but found it to be more complex than I could handle in the time frame, I will continue to work on it in the future. 

To run the project locally, change to the server directory and run go build followed by ./server to start the backend server. Then cd to the client directory and run the react server. The application should open on your browser.
